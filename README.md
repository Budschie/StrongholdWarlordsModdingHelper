# StrongholdWarlordsModdingHelper
This is the repository of my stronghold modding helper.

This tool aims at supporting texture packs for the game Stronghold:Warlords by FireFly.
It utilizes ZIP-Archives as modding files. For modders, I will put the specification in the description.

## How to use as a user
Here is a rough outline on what you have to do to add a mod to Stronghold:Warlords:
1. Click on File->Open game. Then, you have to navigate to your Stronghold:Warlords directory. An example, where this directory might be, would be:
   "F:/SteamLibrary/steamapps/common/Stronghold Warlords".
   ![File->Open](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Budschie/StrongholdWarlordsModdingHelper/master/StrongholdWarlordsModdingHelper/Images/OpenImage.png)

2. When you get the message you see below, you are good to go.
   ![The directory was verified successfully.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Budschie/StrongholdWarlordsModdingHelper/master/StrongholdWarlordsModdingHelper/Images/SuccessfullyOpened.png)
3. Now, let's go to the core of this project: The adding of mods. To add a mod to the mod list, you have to
   go to File->Import mod. Then, you will be prompted to open a mod file. Mod files have the file ending ".shwmod",
   which is the short form of "**S**trong**h**old:**W**arlords **Mod**".

4. Now, you have to enable the mod. Simply click on the check-box to enable the mod, as shown below.
   ![Checkbox on Column "Is Enabled"](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Budschie/StrongholdWarlordsModdingHelper/master/StrongholdWarlordsModdingHelper/Images/Checkbox.png)
   
5. Yay, you are finally on the last step. To apply your mods, simply click on Modding->Apply mods. You will be prompted if you
   want to continue, here you can simply click "Yes".
   
5. 1/2: If you want to save your mod setup, you can go to File->Save mod configuration. You will be prompted if the save succeeded.
